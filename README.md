      "Carpe Diem is, ironically, a fire and forget web App. 
      Users input data to get their life expectancy, set LARGE life goals and then 
      proceed to receive custom notifications (via text/email) about their LARGE goals
      with a reminder about how much time they have left to live; at a rate they desire.",

  
    features: 
      "Hacked life expectancy calcutor API from blue print income",
      "Designed a class method to run daily via rake, scraping all user(s) and runs notifications
      based on their settings w/o  recursion",
      "Facial Recognition login with maintainable scalable database of all users’ faceID+photo."
